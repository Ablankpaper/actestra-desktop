## Current phase

### P3 — Platform Core and Contracts

P3.1-P3.6 and review remediation are pushed and CI-backed. The full independent
review and remediation review are complete. On 2026-07-28 the owner authorized
the next gate and pull request 3 became Ready. P3 remains open until merge and
exact `main` CI.

P0, P1, and P2 are accepted on `main`.
[Pull request 2](https://github.com/bignormal/actestra-desktop/pull/2) merged
the P2 independent product shell with squash commit
`76d6a58b20c3e010ee759358f2c86be80bc6a6c1`. Its exact final PR head was
`f972bb6c33c925f3e333a6ee87d20e5bbb72cece`.
[Main CI run 30329620829](https://github.com/bignormal/actestra-desktop/actions/runs/30329620829)
passes on the exact squash commit.

`feat/platform-core-contracts` begins from that verified `main` commit and is
open in
[pull request 3](https://github.com/bignormal/actestra-desktop/pull/3).
P3.1/P3.2 implementation commit
`31dd6e4178eb7641b45be0ee2bccb862a96dac99` adds the P3.1 domain records,
state transitions, and ownership invariants plus the P3.2 version 1 event
envelope, ordering, idempotency, replay, terminal, and redaction rules.
[macOS arm64 CI run 30331681309](https://github.com/bignormal/actestra-desktop/actions/runs/30331681309)

`4de756984269624a02fbfdf77e558c958a03c2e0` accepts
[ADR-0005](architecture/decisions/0005-sqlite-persistence-and-migrations.md)
and implements storage-neutral persistence ports, two forward-only SQLite
migrations, a main-owned domain/event adapter, corruption and rollback checks,
and an exact Electron-runtime compatibility probe.

[ADR-0006](architecture/decisions/0006-agent-adapter-lifecycle-and-supervision.md)
and adds protocol version 1, exact capability negotiation, an `AgentAdapter`
contract, observed-time lifecycle supervision, immutable attempts, terminal
reconciliation, cancellation, crash, bounded restart, and an explicitly
stepped deterministic fake adapter.
[macOS arm64 CI run 30339662937](https://github.com/bignormal/actestra-desktop/actions/runs/30339662937)

`cec0cdc554656c021cdff7f2341ddd3f9b5d83dd` accepts
[ADR-0007](architecture/decisions/0007-privileged-service-authorization.md)
and adds closed protected-operation and tool-manifest contracts, conservative
policy evaluation, exact one-shot approval evidence, opaque credential leases,
a metadata-only audit trail, and a fixed-order main-owned gateway.
[macOS arm64 CI run 30345370507](https://github.com/bignormal/actestra-desktop/actions/runs/30345370507)

and adds SQLite schema version 3, durable metadata-only privileged audit,
immutable terminal-attempt evidence, persist-before-release coordination,
main-owned inert service registration, trusted-frame IPC, a three-operation
preload allowlist, and bounded renderer projection.

Review-remediation commit
`4fa0fb120a6ceb2c71effd2a552e8d9bbf05d151` adds bounded structural
comparison, idempotent incremental redelivery, explicit persistence
idempotency contracts, post-replacement stream-cache invalidation, and
evidence-document corrections.
[macOS arm64 CI run 30374144474](https://github.com/bignormal/actestra-desktop/actions/runs/30374144474)
passes on that exact remediation commit.

Review-closure evidence commit
`2fe179a63ac7e8a4d23373fe87dda7b062c314fc` records the complete review,
remediation, validation, and remaining owner gate.
[macOS arm64 CI run 30374447377](https://github.com/bignormal/actestra-desktop/actions/runs/30374447377)
passes on that exact evidence head. The subsequent Ready transition triggered
CodeRabbit run `c55e04d9-8360-4570-a06c-2dec6b5d19e6`, which selected all 67
PR files and completed with a successful status, no review submission, and no
review thread. This Free-plan summary/walkthrough is not represented as an
independent approval.

Application startup now opens the owned SQLite store and registers the
deny-by-default reference services only in main. The fake worker still performs
no filesystem, network, process, shell, model, credential, or tool operation.
There is no secret backend, real executor, input-reference store, production
policy snapshot, worker process, or MCP/native transport.

Local validation of P3.3 at
`4de756984269624a02fbfdf77e558c958a03c2e0` on
`feat/platform-core-contracts`:

- `bun install --frozen-lockfile` — pass with no lockfile change;
- `bun run check` — pass, including format, lint, strict types, 9 Vitest files
  with 54 tests, the exact Electron `37.10.3` / Node.js `22.21.1` / SQLite
  `3.50.4` probe, the 3-scenario process-failure harness, product-boundary
  check, and desktop build;

  evidence only because P3.3 is not wired into startup;
- `git diff --cached --check` — pass;
- `coderabbit review --agent -t uncommitted -c AGENTS.md` — initial full review
  raised 5 issues (2 major, 3 minor); all were verified and remediated without
  weakening event invariants; the 17-file post-remediation review completed
  with 0 issues.

Local validation of P3.4 at
`2b1ad9200ff44f2b6be219a8a4b58b0083ebd45b` on
`feat/platform-core-contracts`:

- three focused contract files — pass with 22 tests covering version and
  capability rejection, lifecycle order, messages, approval grant/denial/
  expiry/cancellation, normal and forced cancellation, startup and heartbeat
  timeout, crash, fresh-attempt restart, restart bounds, identity and sequence
  drift, approval-reference drift, and terminal reconciliation;
- `bun run check` — pass, including format, lint, strict types, all 12 Vitest
  files with 76 tests, the exact Electron `37.10.3` / Node.js `22.21.1` /
  SQLite `3.50.4` probe, the 3-scenario process-failure harness, the 21-source
  product-boundary check, and desktop build;
- `bun run test:coverage` — pass after remediation with 81.88% statement,
  75.28% branch, and 93.75% function coverage overall; `core/agentAdapter.ts`
  has 89.71% statement coverage and `main/workers` has 75.86%;
- `bun run docs:check` — pass for all 27 Markdown files;
- `bunx markdownlint-cli2 'docs/**/*.md' 'README.md' 'AGENTS.md'` — pass with
  0 issues;
- `git diff --cached --check` — pass;
- `coderabbit review --agent -t uncommitted -c AGENTS.md` — the first
  tracked-file review raised 1 minor status-wording issue; the complete 13-file
  review raised 4 major lifecycle/validation issues; all were verified and
  remediated, and the final 13-file review completed with 0 issues;
- exact implementation CI run 30339662937 — pass, including source/test/
  boundary, documentation, unsigned bundle, packaged identity, and clean-profile
  smoke steps.

Local validation of P3.5 at
`cec0cdc554656c021cdff7f2341ddd3f9b5d83dd` on
`feat/platform-core-contracts`:

- `bun install --frozen-lockfile` — pass with 443 installs and no lockfile
  change;
- two focused P3.5 contract files — pass with 27 tests covering validation,
  policy, approval, audit, credential-lease, gateway, cleanup, concurrency, and
  post-call uncertainty rules;
- `bun run check` — pass, including format, lint with 0 warnings, strict types,
  all 14 Vitest files with 103 tests, the exact Electron `37.10.3` / Node.js
  `22.21.1` / SQLite `3.50.4` probe, the 3-scenario process-failure harness, the
  27-source product-boundary check, and desktop build;
- `bun run test:coverage` — pass with 84.00% statement, 76.75% branch, and
  95.18% function coverage overall; `core/privilegedServices.ts` has 93.96%
  statement coverage and `main/privileged` has 84.04%;
- `bun run docs:check` — pass for all 28 Markdown files;
- `bunx markdownlint-cli2 'docs/**/*.md' 'README.md' 'AGENTS.md'` — pass across
  24 matched files with 0 issues;
- `bun run dist:dir && bun run verify:package && bun run smoke:package` — pass
  for the unsigned arm64 app and isolated shell profile; this is regression
  evidence only because P3.5 is not wired into startup;
- `git diff --cached --check` — pass before the implementation commit;
- three completed CodeRabbit CLI reviews raised 14 issues: 1 critical,
  10 major, and 3 minor. All were verified and remediated. A fourth final CLI
  retry was rate-limited before review and therefore is not zero-issue evidence;
  the remote CodeRabbit status is `SUCCESS` on the pushed implementation head;
- exact implementation CI run 30345370507 — pass, including source/test/
  boundary, documentation, unsigned bundle, packaged identity, and clean-profile
  smoke steps.

Validation of P3.6 implementation commit
`950fe0efa2fdc5adc69d013acc9f417d201cb28e`:

- the first contract, preload, and IPC group passed 4 focused files with 9
  tests after the intended red phase;
- SQLite migration and platform-evidence groups passed restart-continuity,
  idempotency, immutable-conflict, bounded-read, and projection-corruption
  tests;
- terminal-attempt unit and SQLite integration tests prove event persistence,
  metadata evidence, failure retention, idempotent retry, and supervisor release
  order;
- `bun run check` — pass, including format, lint with 0 warnings, strict types,
  all 24 Vitest files with 129 tests, the exact Electron `37.10.3` / Node.js
  `22.21.1` / SQLite `3.50.4` probe, the 3-scenario process-failure harness, the
  34-source product-boundary check, and desktop build;
- `bun run test:coverage` — pass with 84.15% statement, 76.59% branch, and
  94.30% function coverage overall; `main/ipc` has 92.85% statement coverage,
  `main/persistence` has 87.92%, and the preload bridge has 90.90%;
- `bun run dist:dir && bun run verify:package && bun run smoke:package` — pass
  for the unsigned arm64 app, packaged identity, and isolated application,
  window, and renderer-ready markers with SQLite v3 active;
- documentation links and lint pass. Two CodeRabbit CLI reviews raised six
  valid issues (1 critical, 2 major, and 3 minor), all remediated; a third
  tracked-file pass returned zero issues. A full staged-diff retry was
  rate-limited before review and is not zero-issue evidence. A manual full-diff
  audit found and remediated two additional defensive gaps;
- exact implementation CI run 30350732223 — pass, including source/test/
  boundary, documentation, unsigned bundle, packaged identity, and clean-profile
  smoke steps;
- the explicit remote 67-file CodeRabbit review request was also rate-limited
  before review. Its `SUCCESS` status represents command handling, not completed
  review; GitHub has no review submission or review thread on the implementation
  head.

Review closure validation at
`4fa0fb120a6ceb2c71effd2a552e8d9bbf05d151`:

- `coderabbit review --agent -t committed --base main -c AGENTS.md` completed
  against all 67 PR files at pre-remediation head
  `164be7da1b73ffeb8da813e33268ccaf4a77b7ad` and raised 10 issues: 4 major
  and 6 minor;
- nine issues were verified and remediated. One minor request to replace
  kickoff CI run 30329964305 with the earlier run 30329899300 was rejected
  after GitHub verification showed that both passed, but 30329964305 is the
  later canonical run on exact head
  `b9c1119479c805c02452e4054a3d904649a3ca03`;
- four focused files pass 23 tests. `bun run check` passes format, zero-warning
  lint, strict types, the exact Electron SQLite probe, all 24 Vitest files with
  130 tests, the process-failure harness, 34-source boundary check, and build;
- `bun run test:coverage` passes with 84.16% statement, 76.70% branch, and
  94.30% function coverage. Documentation links and Markdown lint pass with
  zero issues;
- unsigned arm64 packaging, packaged identity, and isolated application,
  window, and renderer-ready smoke pass;
- the first nine-file remediation review raised one minor immutable-evidence
  wording issue, which was fixed. The second nine-file review completed with 0
  issues;
- a final redundant 67-file confirmation attempt was rate-limited during setup
  with a 43-minute wait. It is not represented as zero-issue evidence; closure
  rests on the completed full review plus the completed zero-issue remediation
  review;
- exact remediation CI run 30374144474 passes all source/test/boundary,
  documentation, unsigned bundle, package identity, and clean-profile smoke
  steps.

## Accepted direction

- Actestra is independent from Aera.
- AionUi is an evaluated desktop and general-work reference; any reuse enters as
  a selective, attributed port behind an Actestra boundary.
- Goose is integrated through a specialized worker adapter.
- Eigent is initially a product and orchestration reference, not a wholesale
  runtime import.
- Actestra owns workspaces, tasks, permissions, credentials, events, artifacts,
  and audit history.
- External workers run behind stable adapter, event, and policy boundaries.

## P2 acceptance evidence

| Requirement | Result |
| --- | --- |
| Independent identity, icon, protocol, and data path | Pass on merged `main` |
| No upstream or Aera brand, account, endpoint, updater, telemetry, or application source | Pass on merged `main` |
| Sandboxed renderer and narrow preload bridge | Pass on merged `main` |
| Deny-by-default permissions, navigation, windows, and external network | Pass on merged `main` |
| Account-free clean-profile launch | Pass locally and in CI smoke |
| Unsigned macOS arm64 app, DMG, and ZIP packaging | Pass locally; deliberately non-candidate |
| Packaged identity, notices, CSP, and architecture verification | Pass locally and in CI |
| Independent review remediation | 13 valid CodeRabbit CLI issues fixed; one invalid `void` Promise suggestion documented |
| Final GitHub review | No submitted review; CodeRabbit summary/status succeeded on the exact final head with 0 review threads, then the owner merged after CLI remediation and CI |
| Final PR-head CI | Pass on `f972bb6c33c925f3e333a6ee87d20e5bbb72cece` |
| Main CI | Pass on squash commit `76d6a58b20c3e010ee759358f2c86be80bc6a6c1` |

Detailed commands, review history, package hashes, screenshot, and non-claims are
in [P2 Product Shell](product/P2_PRODUCT_SHELL.md).

## P3 entry scope

P3 must establish Actestra-owned contracts before any real external worker is
adapted:

1. task, session, workspace, worker, approval, event, and artifact models;
2. a versioned unified event envelope and ordering rules;
3. the `AgentAdapter` lifecycle and deterministic fake worker;
4. persistence ports, an accepted storage decision, and forward migrations;
5. credential, policy, approval, MCP/tool, and audit service boundaries;
6. heartbeat, timeout, crash, restart, and cancellation semantics;
7. tests proving the renderer cannot bypass main-process authority.

The ordered implementation index and P3 non-claims are in
[P3 Platform Core](product/P3_PLATFORM_CORE.md).

## Next gate

1. Keep pull request 3 Ready but unmerged until the owner explicitly authorizes
   the merge step.
2. Before merging, re-check the exact PR head, current-head CI, mergeability,
   review submissions, review threads, and release non-claims.
3. After merge, wait for exact `main` CI before recording P3 as accepted.
4. Do not begin P4 or integrate a real AionUi, Goose, Eigent, or other worker
   until P3 is accepted.

## Open decisions

- License for original Actestra source.
- Credential storage mechanism and platform-keychain boundary.
- Main-owned input-reference storage and MCP/native-tool transport.
- Worker sandbox implementation per operating system.
- Long-term dependency upgrade policy.
- Code-signing, notarization, update, and distribution accounts.
- Cloud identity or sync scope, which remains outside the initial MVP unless
  promoted by a new product decision.

## Known blockers and non-claims

- P3.1 through P3.6 and review remediation are CI-backed. The technical review
  and Ready gates are closed, but P3 is not accepted because merge and exact
  `main` CI are still pending.
- The final redundant full-diff confirmation was rate-limited before review and
  is not zero-issue evidence. The completed 67-file review plus the completed
  zero-issue nine-file remediation review are the review-closure evidence.
- Main startup registers SQLite v3 and inert P3.5 reference services, but no
  protected operation, tool transport, credential value, or worker control is
  renderer-visible.
- The P3.4 deterministic fake is test infrastructure, not a worker process or
  evidence of packaged crash recovery.
- P3.6 makes metadata-only audit and terminal-attempt evidence durable.
  Approval, credential-lease, and policy state remains in memory and contains no
  secret value or real tool execution.
- SQLite still runs synchronously in main; it must move behind a supervised
  persistence utility before real user-workload writes are enabled.
- No real worker may be integrated until the P3 contracts and fake-worker gate
  pass.
- The local P2 package remains deliberately unsigned and is not a candidate.
- The `main` branch currently has no GitHub branch-protection rule; explicit
  owner-gated PR discipline remains required.
- CI runs 30339662937 and 30350732223 passed, but GitHub annotated the pinned
  checkout and setup-node actions as Node 20-targeting actions forced onto Node
  24; this is a dependency-maintenance item, not failed P3 evidence.
- Signing, notarization, SBOM, provenance, clean-machine installation, update
  metadata, and cross-platform acceptance remain future gates.
- There is no release, deployment, distribution, or user acceptance.

## Update policy

Every material status update must state:

- exact branch and commit;
- commands run and their results;
- whether evidence is local, pushed, CI-backed, packaged, released, deployed, or
  user-accepted;
- unresolved blockers;
- the next phase gate.
